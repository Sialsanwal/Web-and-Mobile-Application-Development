        <p>

            as jQuery) then feel free to , bu we only be grading correctness on your CSS and HTML.
        </p>
        <p>If you can, <b>Start Early!</b></p>

        <h2>Part One</h2>
        <h3>Specifications</h3>
        <p>
            Now that you understand some basic of HTML and CSS, let's take a took at how to allign the element. There
            are multiple ways to allign HTML elements, but in this part, we recommand using flexboxes as they widely
            used in modern web development(for example bootstrap V4 is built on top of flexboxes.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Refer to this great webpage on how to used flexboxes: <a href="">Link</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Also feel free to use online resource such as Stack Overflow , MDN, W3 and Google for refrences.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you open the provided HTML file part1/index.html, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment 1</h3>
        <h4>Provided Example</h4>
        <h4>Row 1</h4>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="flex-item">1</div>
            <div class="flex-item">2</div>

        </div>




        <p>
            we will describe how each row will behave dynamically and provide some hints for a possible approach:

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>For the third row, the red and blue rectangles should remain the same width, and the green space should
                shrink.</li> <br>
            Possible Approach: Have a div with red background and a div with a blue background both with fixed widh. Use
            an appropraite value for <a href="">justify content</a>. <br>
            <br>
            <li>
                For the fourth row, the blue end rectangle should remain the same width, and the red rectangle should
                shrink. <br> <br>
                Possible Approach: Have a div with a red background and a div with a blue background. Have a fixed width
                on the blue div. Use <a href="">Flex Grow</a>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                For the fifth row, the end square should remain the same size, but always remain in the center of green
                rectangle.
                <br> <br>
                Hint: Think about how to keep a div fixed size and how to align something in the absoulte center of the
                parent element.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                For the sixth row, the blue rectangle should remain the same size while the red rectangle should shrink.
                The blue rectangle should remain in the center of the rows. <br>
                <br>
                Hint: Use two red divs. <br>

            </li> <br>
            <li>
                For the seventh row, the red rectangle should remain in same width. <br>
                <br>
                Hint: Nest divs and use <code class="codetext">background-color: transparent</code>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                For the eight row, the orange rectangle should remain the same size while the green space between them
                shrinks.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                For the ninth row, the green space between the orange rectangle should remain the same width while the
                orange rectangle narrow.
            </li>
        </ol>


        <p>
            The example we provided with the first two rectangle blocks use flexboxes. You are not required to use
            flexboxes for the next 7 rows, but we recommend, it is as it will be usefull in part 2 of this assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should only have to use the <code class="codetext">div</code> html element to complete the assignment.
            Also,<b>none of the divs you create inside of the provided wrapper divs should have <code
                    class="codetext">background-color:green;</code> </b>. But it is valid to specify non-green
            background color for any divs including the wrappers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try to style the boxes are closely to the solution image as possible don't worry about getting exact
            dimensions or rgbs value. We care about whats strcuture, CSS style you should used, and the dynamic behavior
            of the page. However just for refrence,
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li> The Color of the boxes we used are <code class="codetext">background-color:</code>
                <code><mark id="redcode">red</mark> </code> <code>blue</code> and <code>orange</code>
            </li>
            <li>Some width/height values we used are <code class="codetext">20px, 40px, 80px</code></li>

        </ol>
        <p>
            You are not required to use bootstrap in this part. You can used if you want but we acctually recommend
            writing plans with HTML and CSS. Just for this part inline CSS is acceptable , but you should generally
            avoid using inline CSS in future.
        </p>
        <h2>General Notes</h2>
        <p>
            As a remainder it's good idea to run your HTML and CSS syntax through validators. You should also consider
            using an accessabilty checker such as WAVE.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Troubleshooting
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are hundreds of HTML and CSS tags, properties and values, and we do not expect student to learn each
            one by heart. However this assignment and the first lab are intended for you to intivitevely understand the
            language and to be proficient at knowing how to tackle the design by the end of the semester. <br> <br>
            If you're having problems there are many guides to HTML and CSS online (CSSTricks and MDN are you friends,) as well as on our resource page.
            <br> <br>
            As always, if you are stuck on a particular part, you can always talks to be friendly TAs or ask question on course piazza (Check your mail for a signup link). <br><br>
            <b>As a general rule of thumb , do not expect TAs to be able to solve every web problem you have. Even the most adept web  developer  can strugle a lot with specific CSS rules to use.</b>
        </p>
