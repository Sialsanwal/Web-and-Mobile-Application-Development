            <p>Who is that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him times over? <cite>(Surat
                    Baqara,Veerse 245)</cite></p>
            <br><br>
            <P>
                "should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing, instills upon his men to give
                Qarz-e-Hasana because it is in man's nature to be frugal whilst spending his wealth. Allah speaks about
                qarz because it is returned and Allah promises that He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds. Allah
                conveys his message to the Muslim ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad prompting Muslims to spend
                heir wealth in a certain way. He says, Oh children of Adam! Trust me with your wealth. If you do so, no
                fire, flood or thieves will be able to rob you off your money. Instead, you will be endowed with your
                wealth when you most need it. He further says that the poor and weak will not remain hungry and naked
                except due to the negligence of the rich, who should not be stingy in spending their money on those
                vorse off than themselves. Allah will not only take strict accountability from those people but He will
                also punish them accordingly. On the Day Of Judgement, the rich will be humiliated because they did not
                help the needy. The needy will complain to Allah and say that all those men on whom you graciously
                bestowed the rights of wealth showed negligence in its proper use; they were busy spending on themselves
                and forgot about us, the ones who needed it. Allah will reply to this and say: "I swear on my respect
                and glory! I will bring you closer to me and push them further away."
