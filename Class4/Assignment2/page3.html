            <h1>Semantic Elements</h1>
        </span>
        <p>
            When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic <span style="color: red;">HTML</span> and
            Semantic <span style="color: red;">HTML</span>. <br> The word; semantic means <b><i>"relating to
                    meaning"</i></b>, so semantic elements provide information about the content between the opening and
            closing tags.
        </p>
        By using Semantic <span style="color: red;">HTML</span>, we select <span style="color: red;">HTML</span>
        elements based on their meaning, not on how they are presented. Elements
        such as <br><code>&lt;<b>div</b>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;<b>span</b>&gt;</code> are not semantic elements since
        they provide no context as to what is inside of those
        tags.
        <p>
            For example, instead of using a
            <code>&lt;<b>div</b>&gt;</code> element to contain our header information, we could use a
            <code>&lt;<b>header</b>&gt;</code> <br> element, which is used as a heading
            section. By using a <code>&lt;<b>header</b>&gt;</code> tag instead of a <code>&lt;<b>div</b>&gt;</code>, we
            provide context as to what information is inside
            of the opening and closing tag.

        </p>

        <span style="color: blue;">
            <h2>Why we used Semantic Element?</h2>
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Accessibility:</b> Semantic <span style="color: red;">HTML</span> makes webpages accessible for
                mobile devices and for people with <br>
                disabilities as well. This is because screen readers and browsers are able to interpret the code better.
            </li>
            <li><b>SEO:</b> It improves the website <b>SEO</b>, or <b>S</b>earch <b>E</b>ngine <b>O</b>ptimization,
                which is the process of increasing the
                number of people that visit your webpage. <br> With better <b>SEO</b>, search engines are better able to
                identify
                the content of your website and weight the most important content appropriately.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Easy to Understand:</b> Semantic <span style="color: red;">HTML</span> also makes the website's
                source code easier to read for other web
                developers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic <span style="color: red;">HTML</span> to
            going into a store with no signs
            on the aisles. Since the aisles aren't labeled, you don't know what products are in those aisles. <br>
            However,
            stores that do have signs for each aisle make it a lot easier to find the items you need, just like Semantic
            <span style="color: red;">HTML</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many web sites contain HTML code like:
        <code> &lt;div id="header"&gt;, &lt;div id="nav"&gt;, &lt;div id="main"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code>, &lt;div id="footer"&gt; to indicate header, navigation, main
                        content and footer.
                        </p>
